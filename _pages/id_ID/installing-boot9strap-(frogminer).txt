{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

To install boot9strap on your 11.9.0 device, we exploit an oversight in the security restrictions applied to "DSiWare" applications.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key (`movable.sed`) for your device.

We then use this DSiWare encryption key to decrypt a compatible DSiWare application and inject an exploit into it to run our own code.

If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key (`movable_part1.sed`) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption. For information on how Seedminer works, please see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34â…•c3).

Note that this tool requires a PC with a powerful graphics card to break your device's DSiWare encryption. If you do not have access to one of these, there exists an online helper service where a volunteer running automated software will do this for you.

To use the [magnet](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

To extract the `.7z` and `.rar` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

This process will overwrite your game's save file!
